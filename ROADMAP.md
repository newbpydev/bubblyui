## Timeline and Prioritization

This roadmap presents a comprehensive vision for BubblyUI. The phases should be approached in order, as each builds upon the previous. However, within each phase, tasks can be prioritized based on team capacity and specific needs.

### Test-First Development Approach

A critical aspect of our development methodology is the commitment to test-first development. For each component and system:

1. Write comprehensive tests before or alongside implementation
2. Include edge case testing in all test suites
3. Establish performance benchmarks from the start
4. Test components in isolation and in composition
5. Never move to the next component until current tests pass at 100%

### Initial Focus

Our immediate priorities are:
1. Core reactive state system with comprehensive tests
2. Basic component model with edge case handling
3. Bubble Tea integration with performance benchmarks
4. Essential components with thorough test coverage

These foundation elements will enable early adopters to start using BubblyUI while the more advanced features are developed.

## Conclusion

This roadmap outlines the journey from concept to a fully-featured component-based reactive TUI framework. By following this path, BubblyUI will provide Go developers with a modern, maintainable approach to building complex terminal user interfaces with the elegance of web frameworks like React and Solid.js, but optimized for the terminal environment.
