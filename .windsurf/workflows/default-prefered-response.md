Always think systematically for all tasks. Take it one step at a time and work in order from top down because some tasks need to be implemented first before. At the end of completing tasks, update the Roadmap file, and check what are our next objectives, and provide a summary of what has been done, and what we will next work on, don't deviate from the Roadmap, this is our source of truth from the project. I am heavily using TDD, so stress test the code to make sure that all possible scenario has been thought of and is making sure that the all angles are covered. We don't want any unexpected behavior from our code. I will post the tasks, and you need to complete them, and ask for the next tasks. Do not do anything other than our tasks. We will complete them one step at a time, so make sure to keep our Roadmap up-to-date.

Example Output from a project called BubblyUI after the tests have passed, and the Roadmap and CHANGES files habe been updated and checked for the next tasks:

Great work! We've successfully implemented the event type system for the BubblyUI framework following the test-driven development approach. All tests are passing, and I've updated the ROADMAP.md to reflect our progress.

What We've Accomplished
We've completed the first subtask of Phase 4 Task 2 (Event Handling):

✅ Create event type system

✅ Designed generic Event interface
✅ Implemented standard event types (keyboard, mouse, window size)
✅ Created custom event type factory
✅ Added event metadata structure
✅ Designed event type hierarchy/categorization
Our implementation includes:

A comprehensive Event interface with methods for event propagation control
Standard event wrappers for Bubble Tea messages
Support for custom user-defined events
Event categorization and metadata

Next Steps
Should we add more edge cases to the tests or should we move on to our next tasks? If so, please provide the list of the next tasks:
