# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This document captures key architecture decisions for the BubblyUI project, including the context, alternatives considered, and rationale for each decision.

## ADR-001: Component-Based Architecture

### Context

BubblyUI aims to provide a more maintainable and composable approach to terminal UI development than traditional Bubble Tea applications. The project needs to determine the fundamental architectural model.

### Decision

We will implement a component-based architecture inspired by React/Solid.js that allows independent, reusable UI components with isolated state.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Enhanced Model-View-Update (MVU)**: Extend Bubble Tea's Elm-inspired architecture with better composability.
2. **Widget-based library**: Similar to Tcell/tview with a focus on widgets rather than components.
3. **Retained mode UI**: Use a DOM-like tree with mutations rather than functional re-rendering.

### Rationale

A component-based architecture provides:
- Better separation of concerns
- Reusable UI elements
- Simpler mental model for complex UIs
- Familiar patterns for developers coming from web frameworks
- Natural composition of UI elements

While it requires more upfront design work, this approach addresses the core pain points of Bubble Tea's architecture for complex applications.

### Implementation Considerations

- Components will implement a common interface for lifecycle management
- Each component manages its own state
- Components form a tree structure through composition
- The root component integrates with Bubble Tea's program loop

## ADR-002: Signal-Based Reactivity

### Context

Efficient updating of terminal UIs requires a system that can identify and re-render only the components affected by state changes, rather than the entire application.

### Decision

We will implement a fine-grained reactivity system based on Solid.js-inspired signals, which track dependencies and notify dependents when values change.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Direct state mutation**: Allow components to mutate state directly and manually trigger re-renders.
2. **Virtual DOM diffing**: Use a virtual representation of the terminal output and diff it like React.
3. **Event-based pubsub**: Use a traditional observer pattern for state changes.
4. **Immutable state with reducers**: Use an Elm/Redux-like approach with immutable state transitions.

### Rationale

A signal-based reactivity system:
- Provides fine-grained updates that only re-render affected components
- Has excellent performance characteristics for TUIs
- Enables a declarative programming model
- Allows for precise dependency tracking
- Simplifies complex state management across components

The overhead of dependency tracking is outweighed by the benefits of minimizing costly string operations in terminal rendering.

### Implementation Considerations

- Signals will be generic to support any type
- Dependency tracking will be automatic during signal reads
- Updates will be batched to avoid redundant renders
- The system will detect and prevent circular dependencies

## ADR-003: Parent-Child Communication Model

### Context

Components must communicate with each other in a predictable, maintainable way that avoids tightly coupled dependencies.

### Decision

We will implement a unidirectional data flow where:
1. Data flows down from parents to children via props
2. Events flow up from children to parents via callbacks
3. Cross-cutting concerns are handled via a context-like system

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Bidirectional data binding**: Allow two-way binding between parent and child state.
2. **Global state management**: Centralize all state in a global store accessible by any component.
3. **Event bus**: Use a central event bus for component communication.

### Rationale

Unidirectional data flow:
- Makes state changes predictable and easier to debug
- Enforces a clear separation of concerns
- Reduces coupling between components
- Aligns with modern best practices in UI development
- Provides a clear mental model for component interaction

This approach balances the need for component isolation with practical communication requirements.

### Implementation Considerations

- Props will be implemented as immutable struct values
- Callbacks will be implemented as function references in props
- Context will provide a type-safe way to share state across component subtrees

## ADR-004: Lip Gloss Integration

### Context

Terminal UIs require consistent styling and layout to provide a polished user experience. BubblyUI needs to determine how to handle styling in a component-based architecture.

### Decision

We will deeply integrate with Lip Gloss for styling and use a declarative API to define component styles, with support for themes and dynamic styling based on component state.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Custom styling system**: Build a proprietary styling mechanism specific to BubblyUI.
2. **Minimal styling**: Provide only basic styling primitives and leave advanced styling to applications.
3. **Style props only**: Pass all style information explicitly via props with no defaults.

### Rationale

Deep Lip Gloss integration:
- Leverages an established, powerful styling library
- Provides a familiar, CSS-like styling approach
- Enables beautiful terminal UIs with minimal effort
- Allows for component-level styling encapsulation
- Supports theme-based styling for consistent UIs

### Implementation Considerations

- Component styles will be defined through a fluent API
- Default styles will be provided but overridable
- Styles will be reactive based on component state
- Theme context will provide global style settings

## ADR-005: Type-Safe API Design

### Context

Go emphasizes type safety and explicit error handling. BubblyUI's API design needs to align with Go's philosophy while providing a good developer experience.

### Decision

We will leverage Go generics to provide a type-safe API that minimizes interface{} usage and requires explicit error handling.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Runtime type checking**: Use interface{} extensively with runtime type assertions.
2. **Code generation**: Generate type-safe wrappers from interface{}-based core.
3. **Struct embedding**: Use struct embedding for composition rather than generics.

### Rationale

A type-safe API using generics:
- Catches errors at compile time rather than runtime
- Provides better IDE autocomplete and documentation
- Aligns with Go's philosophy of explicitness
- Reduces the need for type assertions and reflection
- Simplifies debugging of type-related issues

### Implementation Considerations

- Use generics for containers like Signal[T], Props[T]
- Provide explicit error returns rather than panics
- Use interfaces for polymorphic behavior only where appropriate
- Minimize use of reflection and empty interfaces

## ADR-006: Test-First Development Approach

### Context

BubblyUI aims to be a reliable framework for building terminal applications. A robust testing strategy is essential for framework stability.

### Decision

We will follow a test-first development approach where component interfaces, signals, and core functionality are designed with testability in mind and implemented alongside comprehensive tests.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Integration testing focus**: Focus primarily on end-to-end and integration tests.
2. **Manual testing**: Rely on manual testing of example applications.
3. **Test after implementation**: Implement features first, then add tests.

### Rationale

A test-first approach:
- Ensures high test coverage from the beginning
- Forces careful API design that considers testability
- Catches bugs early in the development process
- Provides living documentation of expected behavior
- Enables confident refactoring and feature additions

### Implementation Considerations

- Unit tests for all core components and signals
- Integration tests for component composition patterns
- Performance benchmarks for critical paths
- Mocking utilities for testing component interactions
- CI/CD integration to maintain test quality

## ADR-007: Performance Optimization Strategy

### Context

Terminal UIs have specific performance characteristics different from web applications. Rendering performance is crucial for a responsive user experience.

### Decision

We will implement a multi-faceted performance optimization strategy focused on:
1. Minimizing string operations during rendering
2. Batching updates to reduce render frequency
3. Efficient dependency tracking for surgical updates
4. Benchmarking and profiling for continuous optimization

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Optimize later**: Focus on functionality first and optimize only when problems arise.
2. **Low-level optimization**: Focus on low-level optimizations like custom string builders.
3. **Caching only**: Rely primarily on caching rendered output.

### Rationale

A comprehensive optimization strategy:
- Addresses TUI-specific performance concerns proactively
- Ensures scalability for complex applications
- Maintains responsiveness even with complex component trees
- Provides a foundation for identifying bottlenecks
- Balances developer experience with runtime performance

### Implementation Considerations

- Benchmark suite for measuring rendering performance
- Profiling tools for identifying bottlenecks
- Caching mechanisms for stable output
- Memory usage tracking
- Update batching system to coalesce changes

## ADR-008: Bubble Tea Integration

### Context

BubblyUI builds on top of Bubble Tea but provides a different programming model. The integration approach affects both usability and compatibility.

### Decision

We will provide a thin adapter layer that connects BubblyUI's component tree to Bubble Tea's Program interface, allowing BubblyUI applications to leverage Bubble Tea's terminal handling while using the component model.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Fork Bubble Tea**: Create a modified version of Bubble Tea specialized for components.
2. **Complete replacement**: Build terminal handling from scratch without Bubble Tea.
3. **Wrapper only**: Provide only a thin wrapper over Bubble Tea without deeper integration.

### Rationale

A thin adapter layer:
- Leverages Bubble Tea's mature terminal handling
- Provides compatibility with existing Bubble Tea programs
- Allows gradual migration from Bubble Tea to BubblyUI
- Minimizes duplicate code and maintenance burden
- Keeps the focus on the component model rather than terminal details

### Implementation Considerations

- Root component adapts to Bubble Tea's Model interface
- Messages pass through to the component tree
- Commands from components bubble up to Bubble Tea
- Window size events trigger layout recalculations

## Performance Expectations

Based on our architecture decisions, we set the following performance expectations for BubblyUI:

1. **Render Performance**: 
   - Simple components (< 50 nodes): < 1ms render time
   - Medium complexity (50-500 nodes): < 10ms render time
   - Complex applications (500+ nodes): < 50ms render time

2. **Memory Usage**:
   - Base overhead: < 10MB
   - Per component: < 2KB average
   - Signal updates: Negligible overhead

3. **CPU Usage**:
