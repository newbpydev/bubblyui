**Status:** All professional development tools and guidelines implemented  
**Reference:** Best practices from GitHub, Google, and professional open source projects

---

## 🎯 Major Improvements Applied

### 1. **Enhanced Windsurf Rules (.windsurf/rules/)**
**Created comprehensive development guidelines:**

#### Project Context
- Framework identity and architecture patterns
- Go 1.22+ requirement with generics
- TDD mandatory workflow
- Google Go Style Guide compliance

#### Code Standards (10 rules)
- Type safety with generics (no `any` without constraints)
- Error wrapping with context
- Interface design (accept interfaces, return structs)
- Table-driven testing with testify
- Godoc documentation on all exports
- Consistent formatting with gofmt/goimports

#### Bubbletea Integration (5 rules)
- tea.Model interface implementation
- Message-based state changes
- Command-based async operations
- No direct goroutines in components
- Consistent styling with Lipgloss

#### Quality Gates (6 mandatory checks)
- `make test-race` (tests + race detector)
- `make lint` (zero golangci-lint warnings)
- `make fmt` (gofmt + goimports)
- `make build` (compilation)
- `go test -cover` (>80% coverage)
- `go test ./...` (integration tests)

#### Professional Patterns
- **Specs First**: Always read ALL spec files before implementation
- **Ultra-Workflow**: 7-phase systematic development
- **TDD Mandatory**: Write failing tests before implementation
- **Integration Focus**: Each feature must work with existing framework
- **Documentation Updates**: Update specs, godoc, README, CHANGELOG

- **Pull Request Process** (before/during/after phases)
- **Issue Reporting** (bug/feature template guidance)
- **Documentation Standards** (comprehensive update requirements)
- **Security Considerations** (vulnerability reporting process)
- **Community Guidelines** (communication and collaboration rules)
- **Project Goals** (framework vision and alignment)

#### Pull Request Template - Comprehensive Professional Structure
**Enhanced from basic to professional:**

- **Review Checklist** (5 phases: Automated, Code Quality, Framework Integration, Project Standards)
- **Breaking Changes** tracking
- **Security Considerations**
- **Performance Impact** assessment
- **Community Impact** evaluation

#### Issue Templates - Professional Structure
**Bug Report Template:**
- **4-step reproduction** process with setup, code, commands, expected vs actual
- **Complete environment** details (OS, architecture, Go version, tools)
- **Error output** with full stack traces
- **Debugging information** (related components, attempted solutions)
- **Impact assessment** (blocking, major, minor, cosmetic)

**Feature Request Template:**
- **Problem statement** with current workarounds
- **Proposed solution** with API design examples
- **Integration points** with framework features
- **Implementation considerations** (framework alignment, breaking changes, dependencies)
- **Testing strategy** (unit and integration tests)
- **Documentation needs** (API reference, examples, tutorials)
- **Security and performance** impact assessment
- **Community impact** evaluation

#### Additional Professional Files
**CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md:**

- **4-tier enforcement** (correction, warning, temporary ban, permanent ban)
- **Clear reporting** process with contact information
- **Community impact** guidelines

**SECURITY.md:**
